## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow
- [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) - JS Framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For typed JS
- [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) VueJs Utilities


### What I learned

First time using Tailwind, and I was very fun. I liked the easy way to implement styles, especially how easy it was to add a dark mode.

### Useful resources

- [VueUse guide](https://larainfo.com/blogs/vue-3-dark-mode-with-tailwind-css-example) - This helped me to implement taildwind DarkMode in VueJs.
